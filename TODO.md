## To-Do List
- Finish implementation of str.h.
- Replace calls to `seq()` and `str()` with `seq_()` and `str_()` respectively for better debugging.
- Look into removing FAM from `str.h` and `seq.h` to allow C89 usage.
- Using feature checking, make `types.h` C89 compatible.
- Add shuffles and swizzles to `simd.h`.
