# The Circa Library Set
## NOTE: The API is subject to change at any time presently. This is not a stable, commercial-grade library.

Circa aims to help GNU or ISO C99-and-up programs handle dynamically allocated
data structures more easily and in a more performant manner than the
"idiomatic" way of doing things in C.

Right now the API is rather unstable and previously existing documentation
has been scrapped to be redone later, so using this library is not recommended
at the moment.
